> **Abstract:** *In this paper, we present our on-going effort of constructing a large-scale benchmark, DeeperForensics-1.0, for face forgery detection. Our benchmark represents the largest face forgery detection dataset by far, with 60,000 videos constituted by a total of 17.6 million frames, 10 times larger than existing datasets of the same kind. Extensive real-world perturbations are applied to obtain a more challenging benchmark of larger scale and higher diversity. All source videos in DeeperForensics-1.0 are carefully collected, and fake videos are generated by a newly proposed end-to-end face swapping framework. The quality of generated videos outperforms those in existing datasets, validated by user studies. The benchmark features a hidden test set, which contains manipulated videos that successfully deceived human eyes. We further contribute a comprehensive study that evaluates five representative detection baselines and make a thorough analysis of different settings. We believe this dataset will contribute to real-world face forgery detection research.*

## Overview
### Data Collection
We invited 100 paid actors from 26 countries to record the source videos. Our high-quality collected data vary in identities, poses, expressions, emotions, lighting conditions, and 3DMM blendshapes.
