> **Abstract:** *In this paper, we present our on-going effort of constructing a large-scale benchmark, DeeperForensics-1.0, for face forgery detection. Our benchmark represents the largest face forgery detection dataset by far, with 60, 000 videos constituted by a total of 17.6 million frames, 10 times larger than existing datasets of the same kind. Extensive real-world perturbations are applied to obtain a more challenging benchmark of larger scale and higher diversity. All source videos in DeeperForensics-1.0 are carefully collected, and fake videos are generated by a newly proposed end-to-end face swapping framework. The quality of generated videos outperforms those in existing datasets, validated by user studies. The benchmark features a hidden test set, which contains manipulated videos achieving high deceptive scores in human evaluations. We further contribute a comprehensive study that evaluates five representative detection baselines and make a thorough analysis of different settings. We believe this dataset will contribute to real-world face forgery detection research.*

## Updates
- [05/2020] The [perturbation codes](./perturbation) of DeeperForensics-1.0 are **released**.

- [05/2020] The [dataset](./dataset) of DeeperForensics-1.0 is **released**.

- [02/2020] The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03024) of DeeperForensics-1.0 is accepted by **CVPR 2020**.

## Dataset
DeeperForensics-1.0 dataset has been made **publicly available** for non-commercial research
purposes. Please visit the [dataset download and document page](./dataset) for more details.

We plan to host a challenge, **DeeperForensics Challenge**,
based on DeeperForensics-1.0 dataset. Thus, the hidden test set will not be released.
Looking forward to your participation!

## Code
The code to implement the diverse perturbations in our dataset has been **released**. Please
see the [perturbation implementation](./perturbation) for more details.


## Summary
### Data Collection
We invite 100 paid actors from 26 countries to record the source videos. Our high-quality collected data vary in identities, poses, expressions, emotions, lighting conditions, and 3DMM blendshapes.

### Face Manipulation
We also propose a new learning-based **many-to-many** face swapping method,
 **DeepFake Variational Auto-Encoder (DF-VAE)**. DF-VAE improves *scalability*,
  *style matching*, and *temporal continuity* to ensure face swapping **quality**.

Many-to-many (three-to-three) face swapping by a **single** model:

### Real-World Perturbation
We apply 7 types (transmission errors, compression, *etc.*) of distortions
at 5 intensity levels. Some videos are subjected to a mixture of more than
one distortion. These perturbations make DeeperForensics-1.0 better simulate
real-world scenarios.

### Benchmark
We benchmark five representative forgery detection methods
using the DeeperForensics-1.0 dataset. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03024)
for more information.
